# HIL NixOS Setup

Eventually, we will support fully automating the setup process. But *for now*,
one first needs to do some manual bootstrapping.


## Installing NixOS to a liveusb

On the ASUS NUCs, they don't support MBR partitioned live usbs. But for some
inexplicable reason the official NixOS installer *only* exists as a MBR partitioned
disk. This means we need to build our own GPT/UEFI based NixOS live usb ;(

To work around this limitation of the official installer, we provide a liveusb
image that has NixOS on it, via [disko][disko]. The easiest way to get this liveusb image
is from the CI artifacts, it is built by the [Nix CI][nix ci] job.

Once you download it, unzip it and `zstd --decompress` it, you will have a `nixos.raw`
file. Plug your flashdrive in, identity the *disk* (not partition) of the flashdrive
using either `sudo fdisk -l` on linux or `Disk Utility` on macos. For example,
`/dev/sda` on linux (not `/dev/sda1`) or `/dev/diskX` on macos (not `/dev/diskXsY`).
Run the following:

```bash
sudo cp nixos.raw /dev/<your-usb-disk>
```
This loads the liveusb onto the flashdrive.


## Use the liveusb to install NixOS

### Booting from the liveusb

This is the same as any other linux liveusb. Get into your boot menu using the
function keys at boot, and select the USB from the boot options. Note: on the NUC, it
can only boot GPT/UEFI based liveusbs, MBR ones won't show up in the boot options. This
is why we had to build our own liveusb in the previous section. You will likely need
to disable UEFI secure boot as well.

### Configuring Internet

You can plug in an ethernet cable (easier), or you can connect to wifi with `nmcli`.

```
nmcli connection delete 'Your SSID Here'
nmcli device wifi connect 'Your SSID Here' password 'your password here'
```

### Performing installation

Assuming your intended hostname is `worldcoin-hil-foo-0` (replace this with the real
hostname you have set up in the nix flake beforehand), run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/worldcoin/orb-software.git ~/orb-software  # you can add --branch your-branch if you want
sudo disko-install --flake ~/orb-software#worldcoin-hil-foo-0 --disk main /dev/nvme0n1 # dont forget to replace the hostname
```

Once installed, you can remove the liveusb and reboot the computer. It should boot into
NixOS once the usb is removed - if it doesn't, something was wrong.

## Setting up Remote Connectivity

First, set up wifi just like you did in the previous section with nmcli (or ethernet).

Then, we will set up two things: tailscale and teleport. If you are assisting someone
remotely, once tailscale is up, they will be able to ssh in and take things over from
there.

### Setting up tailscale (Do this first!)

Run the following in the HIL. It will print a url to the console when its the first time on this
machine.
```bash
sudo tailscale up
```
Go to the URL on your laptop, log in with your tfh google account. This will connect
the device to the tailscale network. From this point forward, any other computer that
is connected to tailscale will also be able to ssh into the HIL, even without teleport.

Now is a good time to let the remote person take over, or switch to ssh from your laptop
if that is more convenient than physical access.

NOTE: If you are trying to connect with tailscale from a company device, be sure that
cloudflare warp is turned off, as it can conflict with the tailscale VPN.

### Setting up Teleport

1. Request teleport token for a HIL in slack. You will receive a bash one-liner.

**DO NOT RUN THE BASH, THIS IS AN EXAMPLE:**
```bash
sudo bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://teleport-cluster.orb.internal-tools.worldcoin.dev/scripts/ffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff/install-node.sh)"
```
The command you received on slack should look like something of the above.

Instead of running the command, delete everything except the `curl` command and then
redirect that to a file called `teleport-install.sh`, for example:
```bash
curl -fsSL https://teleport-cluster.orb.internal-tools.worldcoin.dev/scripts/ffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff/install-node.sh > teleport-install.sh

```

Be sure that `teleport-install.sh` is put on the HIL, you can put it in the home directory
for now. Again, *DO NOT RUN THIS SCRIPT*.

2. Place the following content on the HIL at `/etc/teleport.yaml`:
```yaml
version: v3
teleport:
  nodename: SED_HOSTNAME
  data_dir: /var/lib/teleport
  join_params:
    token_name: SED_TOKEN
    method: token
  proxy_server: teleport-orb.worldcoin.dev:443
  log:
    output: stderr
    severity: INFO
    format:
      output: text
  ca_pin: sha256:e0974d24cee9f3494a7ca9d8496f5c67f3fc60ee4bff2f823d2bbdb2c0ea4a2c
  diag_addr: ""
auth_service:
  enabled: "no"
ssh_service:
  enabled: "yes"
  labels:
    hostname: SED_HOSTNAME
  commands:
proxy_service:
  enabled: "no"
  https_keypairs: []
  https_keypairs_reload_interval: 0s
  acme: {}
```

3. run the following from the same directory that `teleport-install.sh` is at on the
HIL:
```bash
TELEPORT_TOKEN="$(cat teleport-install.sh | grep -m1 -oP "^JOIN_TOKEN='\K[^']+")" && [ -n "${TELEPORT_TOKEN}" ] || echo "error: token not found"
TELEPORT_HOSTNAME="$(hostname)"
sudo sed -i "s/SED_TOKEN/${TELEPORT_TOKEN}/" /etc/teleport.yaml
sudo sed -i "s/SED_HOSTNAME/${TELEPORT_HOSTNAME}/" /etc/teleport.yaml
````

This will edit the contents of `/etc/teleport.yaml` to replace the `SED_*` strings with
your hostname and the token.

You can `sudo cat /etc/teleport.yaml` and inspect the file to see the new contents.

4. Run 
```bash
sudo rm -rf /var/lib/teleport
sudo systemctl restart teleport.service && sudo journalctl -fu teleport.service
```

You will see log messages from teleport. Make sure it looks roughly like everything
is normal. Teleport should now be set up.

You will also need to make sure your machine's hostname matches the regex in our
terraform config [here][tf hil].
