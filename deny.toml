# @thebutlah reviewed the license code. It doesn't impose any copyleft
# restrictions on us, and doesn't seem to impose any restrictions on
# distribution. As long as we don't put any other copyleft code in
# orb-software, we won't run afoul of any license restrictions AFAICT. We
# should seek to reimplement pyftdi in rust using nusb if we can, though.
# Because its not good to have these proprietary libs in here.
