# Tweaked proxy code

All files in this directory are *initially* autogenerated with zbus-xmlgen.
However, they then go through some manual edits/tweaks.

The tweaks are Documented with the following comments above tweaked functions:
```
/// MANUALLY TWEAKED (1)
```
The numbers represent the number of the tweak, and are documented in the `lib.rs`.

If you don't need to tweak the file at all, please put it in the
[generated](../generated) directory.
